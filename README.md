# Pick A Number
Android application which allows you to generate a random number within a given interval.

# Tap For Sound

I have developed this Android application back in 2014. I had no Git experience yet, so unfortunately no commit history is available. However, you can look at the code I wrote as an undergraduate.

I thought it would be cool to have an application for generating random numbers ... you never know when the urge for such an app might come.

### Highlights:

- [Variable names in German](https://github.com/vlmaier/pick-a-number/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/vladas/pickanumber/MainActivity.java#L59)
- [Integer Overflow](https://github.com/vlmaier/pick-a-number/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/vladas/pickanumber/MainActivity.java#L59)
